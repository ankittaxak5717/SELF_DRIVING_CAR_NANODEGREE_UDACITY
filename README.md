This is consolidated list of Udacity Self-driving car Nanodegree.

# TERM1 (Computer Vision and Deep Learning)
1) Project: Detect Lane Lines     
Detect highway lane lines from a video stream. Use OpenCV image analysis techniques to identify lines, including Hough transforms and Canny edge detection.  
    

2) Project: Traffic Sign Classification     
Implement and train a convolutional neural network to classify traffic signs. Use validation sets, pooling, and dropout to choose a network architecture and improve performance.
    

3) Project: Behavioral Cloning   
Architect and train a deep neural network to drive a car in a simulator. Collect your own training data and use it to clone your own driving behavior on a test track.     

    
4) Project: Advanced Lane Detection
Detect lane lines in a variety of conditions, including changing road surfaces, curved roads, and variable lighting. Use OpenCV to implement camera calibration and transforms, as well as filters, polynomial fits, and splines.   

5) Project: Vehicle Tracking
Track vehicles in camera images using image classifiers such as SVMs, decision trees, HOG, and DNNs. Apply filters to fuse position data.
