# TERM2 (Sensor Fusion, Localization and Control) 
1) Project: Extended Kalman Filters in C++    
Extended Kalman filters are used by autonomous vehicle engineers to combine measurements from multiple sensors into a non-linear model.

2) Project: Pedestrian Tracking by Unscented Kalman filters    
Fuse noisy lidar and radar data together to track a pedestrian.

3) Project: Kidnapped Vehicle    
Implement a particle filter to take real-world data and localize a lost vehicle.

4) Project: PID Control    
Implement the classic closed-loop controller, proportional-integral-derivative control system.

5) Project: Lane-Keeping   
Implement a Model Predictive Controller to keep a simulated vehicle in its lane.
